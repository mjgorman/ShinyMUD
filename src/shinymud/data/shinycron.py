"""shinycron.py

This script is meant to be called by a cron job. It's purpose is to make sure
that the shinymud server is running, and if not, to restart it. If you have your
email settings configured in your shinymud config file, this script will also
attempt to email anyone in the CRON_NOTIFY list (also in the shinymud config) of
its escapades. Don't worry, it will only email you if the mud actually crashed.

Type the following command in a terminal to edit your crontab file:
crontab -e

Add a new entry to your crontab file that calls the shinycron.py file, like
this one:
*/5 * * * * python /root/git/ShinyMUD/src/shinymud/data/shinycron.py 

That one calls the shinycron.py file every hour. Make sure you include the
absolute path to the shinycron.py file, or things won't work.
